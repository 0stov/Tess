this code is ment to calculate the most efficient way of filling a space.

Have you ever wanted to know how many 3x3 crop plots fit around a scarecrow in stardew vally?
Ever wondered how many hydroponic troughs fit around a sun lamp in rimword?

for example, how many 1x2 boxes fit in a 20x23 space? this will find how many can fit and in what configuration and output the result.

This program will calulate all possible combinations to try and figure out the maximum 2d arrays (bricks)will fit in a larger 2d array (area).
